					<p>All editing and reviewing are conducted by me, Casey Paquola. I’m currently a group leader at the Institute for Neuroscience and Medicine at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany. I hold a Ph.D. from the University of Sydney, Australia (my home country) and was previously a post-doctoral fellow and lecturer at McGill University, Canada.</p>
					<p>With a background in physiology and the philosophy of science, I came to love neuroscience because the field thrives on inter-disciplinary research. Indeed, my team specialises in multi-scale neuroscience, where we work to integrate data and theories across neuroscientific domains, from transcriptomics to cellular architecture to cognition.</p>
					<p>Approved! began out of a passion for good science. As a reviewer for journals such as Nature, Science Advances and PNAS, I’ve often found that the difference between acceptance and rejection depends upon the authors’ ability to eloquently portray the importance of their results. While, as a supervisor and co-author, I see first-hand the difficulty of the write-up process for many good scientists when English is not their forte. The services of Approved! aim to bridge this gap, helping good science to be effectively and clearly communicated.</p>
					<p> Areas of expertise: Neuroscience, medicine, anatomy, physiology, biological sciences. </p>
